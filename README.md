This project focuses on real-time hand sign detection and motion tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It allows the detection of various hand gestures, which can be used for applications such as sign language interpretation, gesture-based control systems, or interactive interfaces.

Features:

+ Real-Time Detection: Efficient hand sign detection with minimal latency.
+ Motion Tracking: Continuously tracks hand movements and gestures in real-time.
+ MediaPipe Integration: Utilizes MediaPipe's powerful hand tracking solution.
+ OpenCV Integration: Leverages OpenCV for video processing and display.
